# SymEx-VP

A [concolic testing][wikipedia ct] framework for RISC-V embedded software with support for [SystemC][systemc website] peripherals.

## About

SymEx-VP focuses explicitly on testing software for
[constrained embedded devices][rfc7228] (e.g. as used in the Internet of
Things). This software often interacts very closely with low-level
hardware peripherals and in order to support these interactions, during
simulation-based software testing, SymEx-VP supports [SystemC][systemc
website] peripheral models. SystemC is a C++ class library for modeling
hardware peripherals. SystemC is often used to create executable models
of an entire hardware platform, so-called Virtual Prototypes (VPs).
Using these SystemC peripherals models, SymEx-VP allows injecting test
inputs into the software simulation via the [MMIO][wikipedia mmio]
peripheral interface. Thereby allowing tests of embedded software with
only minimal software modifications.

Based on injected inputs, SymEx-VP allows [symbolic execution][wikipedia
symex] (or more specifically [concolic testing][wikipedia ct]) of RISC-V
RV32IMAC machine code. Branches based on injected symbolic values are
tracked and as soon as execution terminates new assignments for symbolic
variables are determined by negating encountered branch conditions
(Dynamic Symbolic Execution). For each new assignment, the software
[simulation is restarted][systemc restart] from the beginning, thereby
(ideally) enabling exploration of all paths through the program based on
the introduced symbolic variables.

SymEx-VP is implemented on top of the existing [riscv-vp][riscv-vp github]
codebase and integrates this existing VP with the [clover][clover github]
concolic testing library. More details on SymEx-VP are provided in the
[SymEx-VP paper][symex-vp paper].

## Features

* Concolic execution of RISC-V RV32IMAC machine code
* Accurate hardware peripheral modeling via the SystemC C++ library
* Support for injecting concolic test inputs via the MMIO peripheral interface
* Support for generating test case files and replaying them (see `SYMEX_TESTCASE` below)
* Integrated [GDB][gdb website] stub to ease debugging of encountered errors (`--debug-mode`)
* Support for many embedded operating systems (e.g. [RIOT][riot website], [Zephyr][zephyr website], …)

## Cloning

This repository makes use of submodules to include vendored dependencies.
In order to automatically checkout these submodules clone the repository
as follows:

	$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/agra-uni-bremen/symex-vp

Alternatively, if you already cloned the repository without passing the
`--recursive` option run the following command to checkout all submodules:

	$ git submodule update --init

## Installation

This software can be installed either using [Docker][docker website]
(recommended) or manually via [GNU make][make website].

### Docker

To build a Docker image for SymEx-VP run the following command:

	$ docker build -t riscv-symex .

Afterwards, create a new Docker container from this image using:

	$ docker run --rm -it riscv-symex

The SymEx-VP source directory is then available in
`/home/riscv-vp/riscv-vp` within the container. Provided VPs are
automatically added to `$PATH`. For this reason, the examples provided
in `/home/riscv-vp/riscv-vp/examples` (see below) can easily be executed
within the provided container.

### Manual

Manual installation requires the following software to be installed:

* A C++ compiler toolchain with C++17 support
* [CMake][cmake website]
* A recent version of [Z3][z3 repo] (`4.8.X` is known to work)
* [LLVM][llvm website]
* [Boost][boost website]

After all dependencies have been installed run:

	$ make

Executable binaries are then available in `./vp/build/bin`.

## Usage

In regards to using SymEx-VP for software execution it behaves like a
normal virtual prototype and should be able to execute any RV32IMAC
binaries. In order to utilize the symbolic execution features provided
by SymEx-VP, the following additional aspects have to be consider for
software testing. Communication between software and the virtual
prototype is achieved through memory-mapped IO with a provided
`SymbolicCTRL` peripheral.

1. **Symbolic Inputs:** In order to explore different paths through the
   program, inputs based on which path exploration should take place
   need to be marked as symbolic. Symbolic variables can be introduced
   through SystemC peripherals which return symbolic variables through
   a TLM 2.0 extension as part of memory-mapped I/O. For example, it is
   possible to model an Ethernet peripheral using SystemC which returns
   symbolic variables for network packets and thereby allows exploring
   paths through the network stack of the executed software.
   Alternatively, it is also possible to declare variables as symbolic
   manually through the aforementioned `SymbolicCTRL` peripheral.
2. **Termination Points:** Since SymEx-VP restarts the entire SystemC
   simulation for each new assignment of symbolic input variables,
   termination points need to be defined for the simulated software. For
   example, when exploring the network stack of the executed software,
   it may be sufficient to terminate software simulation as soon as the
   symbolic network packet was handled by the network stack. Termination
   points must presently be declared by the executed software by writing
   to a control register in the memory-mapped `SymbolicCTRL` peripheral.
3. **Path Analyzers:** In order to find errors using symbolic execution,
   a so-called path analyzer needs to be employed on each executed path.
   For each executed path, the employed path analyzer needs to decide if
   the path constitutes an error case. For example, errors may include
   violation of [spatial memory safety][dac checkedc],
   [stack overflows][fdl stack], et cetera. Presently, we mostly rely on
   the executed software to signal an error condition to the virtual
   prototype using the `SymbolicCTRL` peripheral. For example, this
   allows signaling errors from software-specific panic handlers.

## Usage Examples

Usage examples which demonstrate the three aspects mentioned in the
previous section can be found in the `./examples` subdirectory. For
instance, the `./examples/zig-out-of-bounds` demonstrates the discovery
of out-of-bounds array accesses using SymEx-VP. More information on
individual example applications is available in the `README.md` file in
the `./examples` subdirectory.

The provided Docker image already contains a correctly configured RISC-V
cross toolchain. For example, to run the `assertion-failure` example
simply execute the following command inside the container:

	$ make -C examples/assertion-failure/ sim

More complex usage example, e.g. for the integration with embedded
operating systems, are provided as part of the
[evaluation artifacts][symex-vp artifacts] for the SymEx-VP overview
paper. Furthermore, simple test harnesses for using SymEx-VP in
conjunction with the RIOT operating systems are provided in the
[symex-vp-riot repository][symex-vp-riot github].

## Provided VPs

The following virtual prototypes are available:

* `symex-vp`: A very minimal virtual prototype, based on `tiny32-vp`
  from the original riscv-vp repository. This allows testing very basic
  bare-metal RV32 software.
* `hifive-vp`: A virtual prototype mostly compatible with the
  [SiFive HiFive1][sifive hifive1]. This allows executing software
  for embedded operating systems like [RIOT][riot website] or
  [Zephyr][zephyr website] symbolically.

Other platforms from [riscv-vp][riscv-vp github] can be trivially ported.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be set:

* **SYMEX_ERREXIT:** If set, terminate after encountering the first
  error during symbolic execution of the software.
* **SYMEX_TIMEOUT:** This can be used to configure the solver timeout
  of the employed SMT solver, by default no timeout is used. The
  timeout is given in seconds.
* **SYMEX_TIMEBUDGET:** Time budget (in seconds) for path exploration,
  by default the software is explored until all branches have been
  negated.
* **SYMEX_TESTCASE:** This environment variable can point to a test case
  file for replaying inputs causing an error. This is most useful in
  conjunction with `--debug-mode`.
* **SYMEX_DUMPALL:** Create test case files for all generated paths, by
  default test case files are only generated for paths with an error
  condition.
